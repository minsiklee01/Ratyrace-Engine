                    **Project 3: Final**




<!--

General
========

Use this readme to describe what you learned while working on this project.
Also include any problems you ran into, solutions you found, fun things discovered, etc.
This document is your chance to communicate to me what you learned and to show off what you did.
Feel free to include code snippets if it helps.

You should include all the images that you code generated in here along with a short description.
I have added a few reference images (under `references/` folder), but you should delete those and add your own images (under `output/` folder).

Be sure to include a description of the elective(s) and creative artifact.

Hint: it might be good to write a short note on how you know your implementation is doing the correct thing.
For some of the images, this is obvious as you can compare your output with my reference images.
But for other images, it might not be so obvious.


Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.

Take a look at the [Markdeep Feature Demo](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html) to see how you can markup this document.



Submission
-----------

Submit a zip with everything needed to run your project, which includes _ALL_ source code and any extra images.
I will run your submissions on my computer to make sure that all images are produced by your code.
I will read through your readme (this document) to understand how you implemented your source.

Implementations
===============

## Feature 0: Simple brute-force path tracer

Feature 1: Motion Blur
----------------
![](output/motionBlur.png)

Implementing motion blur was fascinating, as I hadnâ€™t anticipated incorporating the element of time into creating a scene.

Feature 2: Blurry Reflections / Refractions
----------------

Feature 3: Texture Mapping
----------------

Feature 4: Light Emitting Sphere

Creative Artifact
===============
![](output/final.jpg)
![](output/snowmanWithLight.jpg)
I made a snow globe with a snowman surrounded by some snow and small balls, all inside a big glass sphere.
Some balls have metal texture while others are simply diffused. 
I added a snow texture to the snowman and snow, and used motion blur to make it look like the snow was falling.

Setting up the scene took a while because even with just a few samples per pixel, rendering still took a few seconds. 
I also had to render a bunch of times to figure out the right x, y, z coordinates for everything.

Overall, it was a fun project. It made me appreciate a real-time rendering technology and all the cool computer graphics I see everywhere.
